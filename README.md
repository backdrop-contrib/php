# PHP Filter

This is a port of the Drupal 7 core PHP module.

Use of this module is considered risky. This module should ONLY be available
to a site admin and only if they are confident in why they need this module.

It is generally considered a MUCH better practice to put your PHP into a custom
module. However, we understand that there are times when the ability to 
execute PHP within the Backdrop UI is convenient. 

We have no plans to release this module and make it available through the 
project installer. Anyone using this module should download it from Github
and install it manually. 

If anyone has ideas on how to make this module less insecure, we welcome them. 

Pull Requests are welcome.
